# Book Lookup

Simple site for looking up book information from an ISBN number.
Includes ability to provide ISBN by uploading a photo of an ISBN barcode.

To be expanded in the future with basic home library functionality.

## Credit/References
- Barcode scanning functionality uses the [Quagga2 library](https://github.com/ericblade/quagga2)
- Book information lookup uses the [OpenLibrary books API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books)

## TODO
- Add library/inventory functionality
- Add unit tests
- Expand documentation
- Change or enhance image upload to allow using camera as barcode scanner (livestream)
